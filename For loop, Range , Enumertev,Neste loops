For Loops in Python
In Python, a for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code repeatedly for each element in the sequence.

1. The Basic Structure of a for Loop
A for loop allows you to repeat a block of code a fixed number of times, or once for each element in a sequence.

Syntax:
for item in sequence:
    # Code to execute for each item in the sequence
Example:
Let’s print each name in a list of Kannada cities:

cities = ["Bengaluru", "Mysuru", "Hubballi", "Mangaluru"]
for city in cities:
    print(city)
Output:

Bengaluru
Mysuru
Hubballi
Mangaluru
Here, cities is a list, and the for loop iterates over each item (city) in that list.
2. Using range() with for Loops
The range() function generates a sequence of numbers, which you can use in a for loop when you want to repeat a block of code a specific number of times.

Syntax of range():
range(start, stop, step)
start: The starting value (inclusive).
stop: The ending value (exclusive).
step: The increment (optional, default is 1).
Example: Counting from 1 to 10
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
This loop will print the numbers from 1 to 10.

Output:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
Example: Counting by 2s from 1 to 10
for i in range(1, 11, 2):
    print(i)
This loop prints only the odd numbers between 1 and 10.

Output:

1
3
5
7
9
3. Looping Over Strings
You can also loop over each character in a string using a for loop.

Example: Printing each character in a string
name = "Karnataka"
for letter in name:
    print(letter)
Output:

K
a
r
n
a
t
a
k
a
This loop goes through the string "Karnataka" one character at a time.

4. Nested for Loops
You can also have nested for loops, which means a loop inside another loop. This is useful when working with multi-level data, like lists inside lists.

Example: Multiplication Table
Let’s print the multiplication table from 1 to 5 using a nested for loop.

for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(1, 6):
        print(f"{i} x {j} = {i * j}")
    print()  # To print an empty line after each table
Output:

1 x 1 = 1
1 x 2 = 2
1 x 3 = 3
1 x 4 = 4
1 x 5 = 5

2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6
2 x 4 = 8
2 x 5 = 10

...

5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
Here, the outer loop controls the first number (i), and the inner loop controls the second number (j). Together, they generate the multiplication table.

5. Using break in a for Loop
The break statement is used to exit a loop early when a certain condition is met.

Example: Stop the loop when you find a specific item
Let’s say you are searching for a specific city in a list:

cities = ["Bengaluru", "Mysuru", "Hubballi", "Mangaluru"]
for city in cities:
    if city == "Hubballi":
        print(f"Found {city}!")
        break
    print(city)
In this case, the loop stops when it finds "Hubballi" and prints "Found Hubballi!".

Output:

Bengaluru
Mysuru
Found Hubballi!
6. Using continue in a for Loop
The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next one.

Example: Skip a specific item in a list
Let’s skip "Hubballi" while looping through the cities:

cities = ["Bengaluru", "Mysuru", "Hubballi", "Mangaluru"]
for city in cities:
    if city == "Hubballi":
        continue
    print(city)
Output:

Bengaluru
Mysuru
Mangaluru
Here, "Hubballi" is skipped, and the loop continues with the next city.

7. Looping Through a List with enumerate()
The enumerate() function allows you to loop over a sequence and get both the index and the value of each item.

Example: Displaying the index and value of each city
cities = ["Bengaluru", "Mysuru", "Hubballi", "Mangaluru"]
for index, city in enumerate(cities):
    print(f"City {index + 1}: {city}")
Output:

City 1: Bengaluru
City 2: Mysuru
City 3: Hubballi
City 4: Mangaluru
8. Using else with for Loops
You can also use an else clause with a for loop. The code inside the else block will execute once the loop finishes, unless the loop is terminated by a break statement.

Example:
for city in cities:
    print(city)
else:
    print("No more cities!")
Output:

Bengaluru
Mysuru
Hubballi
Mangaluru
No more cities!
In this case, after the loop has finished going through all the cities, it prints "No more cities!".

9. Real-Life Example: Distributing Laddus
Imagine you have 5 laddus to distribute among friends. You can use a for loop to give each friend one laddu.

laddus = 5
friends = ["Rahul", "Sneha", "Aman", "Priya"]

for friend in friends:
    if laddus > 0:
        print(f"{friend} gets a laddu!")
        laddus -= 1
    else:
        print("No laddus left!")
Output:

Rahul gets a laddu!
Sneha gets a laddu!
Aman gets a laddu!
Priya gets a laddu!
No laddus left!
Here, the loop goes through the list of friends and distributes the laddus one by one.
